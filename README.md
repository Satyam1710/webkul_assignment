Step by step guidance to run the chat-bot

Step 1. Use either kaggle or Google-colab as they provide GPU. IF we use Google-colab then UI of chat-bot can be diaplayed but if Kaggle is used then UI(User interface) can't be displayed.

Step 2. Set up the input files and in Colab change the runtime to GPU. Input file is attached via this repository (which is ML_book.pdf)

Step 3. Install all libraries and import all of them( Just run the cell )

Step 4. Run all the rest cell as it is, few of them may take little more minutes to run.

Step 5. If you are using Colab then at the end you can see the User Interface after executing the very last cell.

Step 6. Now you can see the UI and you can write your question related to that pdf and chatbot will display its answer accordingly, it may take little bit more time.
